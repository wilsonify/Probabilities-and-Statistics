There are several ways to generalize the simple linear regression model to more complex situations. One way is to
replace the linear function of x with a nonlinear function, such as a polynomial or an exponential function. Another way
is to use a regression function involving more than one independent variable, such as in multiple regression analysis.

Before using these methods, it is important to assess the adequacy of the chosen model. This can be done using graphical
methods, such as a plot of the residuals (observed minus predicted y values) or a normal probability plot of the
residuals. These plots can help identify patterns or deviations from the assumptions of the model, which can indicate
the need for a different model.

In nonlinear regression, we can use functions that are "intrinsically linear", meaning that the relationship between the
variables can be transformed into a linear form. We can also use polynomial regression to model nonlinear relationships.

Multiple regression analysis allows us to build models that relate the dependent variable y to two or more independent
variables. It is important to interpret the output of these models correctly and to be aware of potential pitfalls, such
as multicollinearity (high correlations between the independent variables) and omitted variable bias (leaving out an
important variable from the model). Extensions of multiple regression include methods such as hierarchical linear
modeling and multilevel modeling, which allow us to analyze data with a nested structure, such as data from a randomized
block design.
