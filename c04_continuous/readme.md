The normal (or Gaussian) distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is defined by a bell-shaped curve.
It is one of the most important and widely used distributions in probability and statistics, and it is often used to
model real-world phenomena such as the height of people or the IQ scores of a population.

The normal distribution is defined by its mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ). The mean is the center of the
distribution and the standard deviation is a measure of the spread of the distribution. The normal distribution is
symmetrical, with half of the values lying to the left of the mean and half lying to the right.

There are several other continuous probability distributions that are commonly used in applied work, including the
uniform distribution, the exponential distribution, and the gamma distribution.

To assess whether given sample data is consistent with a specified distribution, we can use statistical tests such as
the chi-squared test or the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. These tests allow us to compare the sample data to the theoretical
distribution and determine whether the two are consistent with each other. If the sample data is consistent with the
theoretical distribution, we can conclude that the sample data is likely to be representative of the population from
which it was drawn. If the sample data is not consistent with the theoretical distribution, we may need to consider
alternative models or explanations for the data.
