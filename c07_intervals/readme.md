A confidence interval is a range of values that is calculated from sample data and is used to estimate a population
parameter. It is an alternative to a point estimate, which is a single value that is used to estimate the population
parameter.

The width of a confidence interval is determined by the sample size, the level of precision desired, and the confidence
level. The confidence level is a measure of the degree of reliability of the interval, and it is expressed as a
percentage. For example, a confidence interval with a 95% confidence level means that we can be 95% confident that the
interval contains the true value of the population parameter.

The most commonly used confidence levels are 95%, 99%, and 90%. The higher the confidence level, the wider the
confidence interval will be, because a higher confidence level implies that we want to be more certain that the interval
contains the true value of the population parameter.

To interpret a particular confidence level, it is important to remember that the confidence level is the probability
that the confidence interval will contain the true value of the population parameter. For example, a 95% confidence
level means that if we repeated the process of sampling and calculating a confidence interval many times, we would
expect the interval to contain the true value of the population parameter 95% of the time.
