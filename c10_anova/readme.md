In analysis of variance (ANOVA), we use statistical methods to compare the means of two or more samples or treatments.
In one-sample problems, we use a single sample to make inferences about a population mean. In two-sample problems, we
use two samples to compare the means of two different populations or two different treatments.

In single-factor ANOVA, we test the null hypothesis that the means of the different samples or treatments are equal. We
do this using the F-test, which compares the variability within the samples or treatments to the variability between the
samples or treatments. If the null hypothesis is true, we expect the within-group variability to be similar to the
between-group variability. If the within-group variability is much smaller than the between-group variability, this
suggests that the means of the samples or treatments are different.

If the null hypothesis is rejected in a single-factor ANOVA, we can use additional statistical tests to determine which
of the means are significantly different from each other. These tests are called post-hoc tests and include methods such
as the Bonferroni correction and the Tukey test.

ANOVA can also be used to analyze experiments involving more than a single factor. In these experiments, multiple
factors or variables are manipulated or measured, and the effects of the different factors on the response variable are
analyzed. This type of ANOVA is called factorial ANOVA and allows us to examine the interactions between the different
factors.
