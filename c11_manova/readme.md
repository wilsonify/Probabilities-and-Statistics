In multifactor experiments, there are two or more factors that are of simultaneous interest. To analyze these
experiments, we can use methods similar to those used in single-factor ANOVA. However, instead of testing for
differences between means, we test for differences between combinations of factor levels.

For example, consider an experiment with two factors, A and B. We might be interested in determining whether the mean
response for each level of factor A is the same, or whether the mean response for each level of factor B is the same, or
whether the mean response for each combination of levels of factors A and B is the same. To test these hypotheses, we
can use a two-way ANOVA, which involves comparing the variability within the different combinations of factor levels to
the variability between the combinations.

A special case of multifactor experiments is the randomized block design, in which one factor (A) is of primary interest
and another factor (blocks) is used to control for extraneous variability. In this design, the subjects or experimental
units are divided into blocks, and each block is randomly assigned to one of the levels of factor A. This allows us to
control for variability within blocks and focus on the effect of factor A on the response variable.

In experiments involving more than two factors, the number of possible combinations of factor levels can become quite
large. In these cases, it may not be practical to observe all of the possible combinations of factor levels. Instead, we
might use an incomplete design, in which observations are made for a selected subset of the combinations. This can be
more efficient and cost-effective, but it can also lead to biases and reduced precision in the estimates of the
treatment effects.
