Probability is a mathematical concept that is used to describe the likelihood of an event occurring. In probability
theory, we assign a probability to each event, which is a number between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating that the event will
not occur and 1 indicating that the event will certainly occur. For example, if there is a 50% chance of it raining
tomorrow, we can say that the probability of it raining tomorrow is 0.5.

Probability theory is a powerful tool that can be used to analyze and understand random phenomena. It is used in many
fields, including science, engineering, economics, and finance. For example, probability theory can be used to
understand the likelihood of different outcomes in a medical trial, to analyze the risk of a financial investment, or to
predict the outcome of a political election.

One of the key principles of probability theory is the concept of statistical independence. This means that the
occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of another event occurring. For example, if you flip a coin, the
probability of getting heads on the next flip is not affected by whether you got heads or tails on the previous flip.
This principle is important because it allows us to use probability theory to make predictions about future events based
on past data.
