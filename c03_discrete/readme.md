In statistical analysis, a random variable is a numerical function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome of a
random event. For example, in a coin toss, the random event is the outcome of the toss (heads or tails), and the random
variable could be the number of heads that occur in a certain number of tosses.

There are two types of random variables: discrete random variables and continuous random variables. A discrete random
variable is one that can take on only a countable number of values, such as the number of heads in a series of coin
tosses. A continuous random variable is one that can take on any value within a certain range, such as the height of a
person.

Discrete random variables are often used to model events that have a finite number of outcomes, such as the number of
heads in a coin toss or the number of people who answer a survey. Continuous random variables are used to model events
that have an infinite number of possible outcomes, such as the height of a person or the time it takes for a chemical
reaction to occur.

The probability distribution of a random variable is a function that describes the likelihood of each possible value of
the random variable occurring. For example, the probability distribution of the number of heads in a coin toss would be
a function that describes the probability of getting 0 heads, 1 head, 2 heads, and so on. The probability distribution
of a continuous random variable is often described using a probability density function, which is a function that
describes the probability of the random variable falling within a certain range of values.
