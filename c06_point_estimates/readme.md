Point estimation is a statistical method for estimating the value of a population parameter based on sample data. The
goal of point estimation is to use a sample to compute a single value that is a "good guess" for the true value of the
population parameter. This value is called a point estimate.

There are several general concepts that are important in point estimation. One of these is bias, which is the difference
between the expected value of the point estimate and the true value of the population parameter. A point estimate is
said to be unbiased if its expected value is equal to the true value of the population parameter.

Another important concept in point estimation is precision, which is a measure of the variability of the point estimate.
A point estimate is said to be precise if it has a small variance, which means that it is not subject to large
fluctuations from one sample to the next.

There are several methods for obtaining point estimates, including the method of moments and the method of maximum
likelihood. The method of moments involves matching the sample moments (such as the sample mean or sample variance) to
the theoretical moments of a known distribution. The method of maximum likelihood involves finding the parameter value
that maximizes the likelihood function, which is a function that describes the probability of the sample data given the
parameter value.

Both the method of moments and the method of maximum likelihood can be used to estimate a wide range of population
parameters, including means, variances, and proportions. These methods are widely used in statistical analysis and have
many important applications in fields such as science, medicine, and economics.
