In hypothesis testing, we can use statistical methods to compare the means, proportions, and variances of two different
population distributions. These methods allow us to determine whether the differences between the two populations are
statistically significant, or whether they could have occurred by chance.

For example, suppose we have two populations of steel specimens, one heat-treated and one cold-rolled, and we want to
determine whether the average Rockwell hardness of the two populations is significantly different. We could collect
samples of hardness observations from each population and use a statistical test, such as a t-test, to compare the means
of the two samples. If the differences between the means of the two samples is statistically significant, we can
conclude that the average Rockwell hardness of the two populations is different.

As another example, suppose we have two populations of nickel-cadmium cells, one produced under current operating
conditions and one produced under modified conditions, and we want to determine whether the proportion of cells with
internal shorts is significantly different between the two populations. We could collect samples of cells from each
population and use a statistical test, such as a z-test, to compare the proportions of defective cells in the two
samples. If the differences between the proportions is statistically significant, we can conclude that the proportion of
defective cells is different between the two populations.

In both of these examples, we are testing the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two populations,
against the alternative hypothesis that there is a difference. If we reject the null hypothesis, we can conclude that
the differences between the two populations are statistically significant. If we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we
cannot conclude that the populations are different.
