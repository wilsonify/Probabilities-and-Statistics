# ## Z test

# To obtain information on the corrosion-resistance properties of a certain type of steel conduit, 45 specimens are buried in soil for a 2-year period. The maximum penetration (in mils) for each specimen is then measured, yielding a sample average penetration of x = 53.8 and a sample standard deviation of s = 4.7. The conduits were manufactured with the specification that true average penetration be at most 50 mils. They will be used unless it can be demonstrated conclusively that the specification $H_a$s not been met. What would you conclude? (Use $\alpha$ = 0.05.)
