In hypothesis testing, we use statistical analysis to decide whether a claim about a population parameter is supported
by the data or whether the data is consistent with the claim being false. This involves formulating a hypothesis,
collecting sample data, and using statistical procedures to determine the likelihood of the data occurring if the
hypothesis is true.

There are several basic concepts and terminology that are important in hypothesis testing. The null hypothesis is a
statement about the population parameter that is being tested. The alternative hypothesis is a statement that
contradicts the null hypothesis. For example, if the null hypothesis is that the population mean is equal to a certain
value, the alternative hypothesis might be that the population mean is not equal to that value.

The test statistic is a numerical value that is calculated from the sample data and is used to evaluate the null
hypothesis. The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one that was
observed, given that the null hypothesis is true.

There are several different types of hypothesis tests that are commonly used, including t-tests, z-tests, and
chi-squared tests. These tests involve comparing the observed test statistic to a known distribution (such as the normal
distribution) to determine the likelihood of the data occurring if the null hypothesis is true.

The decision procedure in a hypothesis test involves comparing the p-value to a predetermined level of significance,
usually denoted by the Greek letter alpha (Î±). If the p-value is less than alpha, we reject the null hypothesis in favor
of the alternative hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than alpha, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. The level of
significance is chosen by the researcher and is typically set at 0.05 or 0.01.
