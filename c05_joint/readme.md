Probability models for the joint behavior of several random variables involve specifying the probability distribution
for all of the variables simultaneously. For example, if we have two random variables X and Y, we can specify a joint
probability distribution that describes the probability of any given combination of values for X and Y.

When two or more random variables are independent, their joint behavior can be described using a product of their
individual probability distributions. For example, if X and Y are independent, the joint probability distribution for X
and Y can be written as the product of the individual probability distributions for X and Y.

Expected values of functions of several random variables can be used to describe the average behavior of the variables.
For example, the expected value of a function of two variables X and Y is the average value of the function over all
possible combinations of values for X and Y.

Covariance and correlation are measures of the degree of association between two variables. Covariance is a measure of
the degree to which two variables vary together, while correlation is a normalized version of covariance that is easier
to interpret and compare.

The Central Limit Theorem is a fundamental result in probability and statistics that states that the average of a large
number of independent, random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the distribution of
the individual variables. This theorem has many important applications, including the use of large sample sizes to make
inferences about population parameters.
