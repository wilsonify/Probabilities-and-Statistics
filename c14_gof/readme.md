The chi-squared goodness-of-fit test is a statistical test used to determine whether a sample comes from a population
with a specific distribution. It does this by comparing the observed frequencies of the categories to the expected
frequencies under the null hypothesis. If the chi-squared test statistic is large, it indicates that the observed
frequencies are significantly different from the expected frequencies, and the null hypothesis is rejected.

In some cases, the null hypothesis may specify that the proportions in each category depend on a smaller number of
parameters, which must be estimated from the sample data before the chi-squared test can be performed. This is often
done when testing whether a sample comes from a particular family of distributions, such as the Poisson or normal
distribution.

There are two types of chi-squared tests that are used in different situations. The first type is used to test whether
the proportions in different populations are the same. The second type is used to test whether two categorical factors
are independent within a single population.

In general, the chi-squared test is a useful tool for testing hypotheses about categorical data and for comparing the
fit of different models to the data. It is important to be aware of the assumptions of the test and to check the
adequacy of the chosen model before performing the test.
