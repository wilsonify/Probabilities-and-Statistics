In statistical analysis, it is often assumed that the underlying population is normally distributed. However, this is
not always the case, and the t and F tests and t confidence intervals may not have the desired levels of significance or
confidence when the population is non-normal.

To address this issue, distribution-free or non-parametric procedures can be used. These procedures are valid for many
different types of underlying distributions and do not rely on the assumption of normality. They can be used for one-
and two-sample tests, as well as for constructing distribution-free confidence intervals and performing
distribution-free ANOVA.

While the distribution-free procedures may not perform as well as their parametric counterparts (such as the t and F
tests) when the population is normal, they can often provide a considerable improvement under non-normal conditions. It
is important to compare the performance of these procedures to the parametric methods in order to choose the most
appropriate approach for a given situation.
